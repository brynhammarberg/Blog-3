### Art Piece 2
![Marius Watz](SonnyRollins.jpg?raw=true "Marius Watz")

The KBG series by Marius Watz was created as a series of images to accompany the international Kongsberg Jazzfestival 2010 held in Norway. Each image is a visual depiction of a jazz piece, ranging from contemporary to classical, from artists such as Sonny Rollins. Watz uses Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) analysis of the soundwaves of the pieces, which translates the specific notes in a sound wave into a visual wave. What initially drew me to this series was the pure visual attractiveness of the interplay between intense colors and explosive form. The knowledge that these are visual representations of music only adds to them. The short video I could find rotates the frame as the jazz piece is played, which one can see is where the explosive shape comes from, shooting out from the center as notes are played.
